	colony buildings
	
	different things for different colony terrains:
	habitat/station stuff if built on space
	asteroid base stuff if built on asteroids
	planetary stuff if built on planets

	'buildings' that indicate terrain of a colony it's built in - which could be affected by uniques
	e.g. asteroid colony could have more defensive strength, etc
	using "Automatically built in all cities where it is buildable" for the building
	idea: could even check for different terrains in a city's territory with this
